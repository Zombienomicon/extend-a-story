===== Upgrading from V 2.0.1 to V 2.1.0 =====

The database has changed for this release. You may want to disable episode
creation before upgrading the database to ensure the database remains in a
consistent state. Log in to the MySQL server using the ExtendAStory database,
and issue this command:

  UPDATE ExtendAStoryVariable
     SET StringValue = 'N'
   WHERE VariableName = 'IsWriteable'

You may want to make a backup of the database before upgrading it, just in
case you have any problems. To upgrade the database, run the database upgrade
script '2.0.1_to_2.1.0.sql' in the existing database.

The code has changed for this release. Simply replace the story code on your
web server with the contents of the www directory. There are two new PHP
scripts in this release that you may want to link to from your story's home
page:

  - admin.php       : Grants access to the administration and moderator
                      functionality.

  - list-locked.php : Displays all episodes that are currently locked for
                      creation.

Point your browser to <story root>/admin.php and login as the administrator:
  - Login Name : admin
  - Password   : change-me

!!! CHANGE THE PASSWORD OF THE ADMIN ACCOUNT !!!

Click on the 'Configure Story Settings' link and change the story
configuration to suit your site. If you disabled episode creation prior to
upgrading the database, be sure to enable episode creation here via the
'Is Writeable' setting. There is also one new setting to configure:

  - Max Edit Days    : The maximum number of days that an author will be
                       allowed to edit an episode after they have created it.
                       Moderators are not affected by this.

There are no documentation changes for this release.
