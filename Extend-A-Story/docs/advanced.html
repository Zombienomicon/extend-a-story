By now you've got a few of your own episodes created. You've mastered the
basic functions of the game. Now you want to see what all of the advanced
features are that everyone has been talking about. This help file is for
you.

<CENTER><H3>Extendable Episodes</H3></CENTER>

Extendable episodes allow the reader to add a new option to the episode at
any time. To make an extendable episode, you select the <B>Make this
episode extendable</B> checkbox while creating it. You still need to
include at least one option, but afterwords, you, or anyone else can add
options to the episode at any time.
<P>
Episodes that are extendable list that fact at the bottom of the page.
They will also have an option labeled <B>Add New Option</B>. When you add
a new option, you are presented with a page similiar to the one presented
when you create an episode. The only difference is a text box that allows
you to enter the description of the option that leads to the episode you
are creating. Everything else about the creation process is identical.

<CENTER><H3>Linkable Episodes</H3></CENTER>

Linkable episodes allow authors to link to that episode from one of the
options they are creating for a new episode. To specify an episode as
linkable you select the <B>Link to this episode later</B> checkbox while
creating the episode.
<P>
When you are creating an episode and want to link to another already
created episode, you need to specify the episode number in the <B>Back
Linked Episode</B> field for the specific option you want to link to
another episode. Leave that field blank if you just want a normal link.

<CENTER><H3>Linking Your Signature to Your Email Address</H3></CENTER>

By entering your email address, and selecting to turn your signature into
a mailto link, you can have your signature be a mailto link pointing to
your email address. This makes your email address viewable to the whole
world, including spammers and other nefarious netizens. Your email address
will not be accessable to anyone unless you check this option. In order
for this to work, you need to specify something in the author name field.

<CENTER><H3>Receive Email When Your Episodes are Extended</H3></CENTER>

If you want to receive email notification any time someone creates a new
episode off of an episode you have written, select the <B>Receive email
when this episode is extended</B> checkbox when creating the episode. You
will receive email each time a child episode of that episode is created.
If the episode is extendable, you will also receive email every time
someone adds a new option. In order for this to work, you must enter a
valid email address. Your address won't be visible to anyone unless you
select to turn it into a mailto link as well.
